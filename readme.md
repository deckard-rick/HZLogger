# HZLogger

Measurement and reporting of temperaturs values from some DS18B20 to analyse a heat-recovery /
heating (German: Heizung).

## Motivation
We are living in passive house without heating.
The original controller for the heat-recovery is so old and without service that we have to
renew it in some years. This old controller has no logging or an interface to connect to.

For this in a first step, I want to learn, what the old controller is doing.
In a first step I want to measure the temperatures on some points
of the heating system and log this on an own server.

## Getting Started

Download and compile with Arduino for your ESP8266 (NodeMCU)

## Running the tests

There are no automatic tests right now

## Deployment

compile it for your iot device
